The leaked transcripts don't fall under an acceptable standard for either of those. Leaking the transcripts with world leaders wasn't done in the name of transparency or for America. It was specifically to hurt Trump. That's it. Someone read it, realized Trump looked like a fool and put it out. 

We know Trump doesn't care about refugees. He's on record saying as much. We know that he is poorly spoken. He's on record for that too. This was someone deciding ""Lol, look how much he sucks compared to other world leaders"" and putting it out there for the laughs. That's a problem because now even leaders who were sympathetic to America, if not Trump, will not trust their conversations with anyone in a position of authority.

It cripples the credibility of our entire government if other governments do not feel secure in negotiations or discussions.

Foreign nationals were suspected of rape in 34.5 percent of cases and they only make 256k of our 5,5mil population(note that most of the immigrants are ""normal"" people).

He appeals to expanding the middle class, but regarding the Amazon strikes and wage increases that resulted, the Democrat leadership only acknowledge the power of organized labor retroactively, *thank* Bezos first for his *generosity* in increasing wages, and refers to the minimum wage factory workers as middle-class, utterly demolishing what 'middle class' means.

Middle class is defined by the rank between wage-labourers and the owning class. Hiring-and-firing, and highly educated professionals. When the Democrats try to call *everyone* 'middle class' down to the minimum wage workers, it means that they're trying to sell policy that'll screw the working class as beneficial to the people they're screwing.

Oct 13, 2011 This is an interesting piece of history......

In 1786, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson met with Arab diplomats from Tunisia, who were conducting terror raids and piracy against American ships (Barbary Pirates). Writing to John Jay, Thomas Jefferson described what he saw as the main issue and the reason why they were attacking Americans who had done them no harm. The following quote is from Thomas Jefferson....

“We took the liberty to make some inquiries concerning the Grounds of their pretensions to make war upon a Nation who had done them no Injury, and observed that we considered all mankind as our Friends who had done us no wrong, nor had given us any provocation. 

--

THE AMBASSADOR ANSWERED US THAT IT WAS FOUNDED ON THE LAWS OF THEIR PROPHET, THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IN THEIR KORAN, THAT ALL NATIONS WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR AUTHORITY WERE SINNERS, THAT IT WAS THEIR RIGHT AND DUTY TO MAKE WAR UPON THEM WHEREVER THEY COULD BE FOUND, AND TO MAKE SLAVES OF ALL THEY COULD TAKE AS PRISONERS, AND THAT EVERY MUSSELMAN (MUSLIM) WHO SHOULD BE SLAIN IN BATTLE WAS SURE TO GO TO PARADISE""

1.  A limit of 10% of immigrants from any one country, per year.  In other words, immigrants from all over the world, not just colonization from one country.  These people are more likely to assimilate into Canada, rather than isolate in their own communities and not even learn the language.

3.  Pay tax on worldwide income (and assets) or get deported and lose your citizenship.

4.  Keep stats on crime rates by country of origin.  Decline immigrants from countries whose previous immigrants have had above average rates of crime.

5.  Provisional immigration and citizenship status for 25 years - commit a crime and get deported with no right of appeal.

If EU politicians really wanted to solve the issue (from previous posts):

The only way to stop the, ever increasing, wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage. They'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk, money, etc... to come illegally in Europe because they'll always end in an external camp.

Note: [Australians are doing just that](https://youtu.be/kNyx1O6panU).

==========================

External camps should be located in non European countries. There would be economic compensation and humanitarian aid.

The cost would be a fracion of what we are spending now. Supporting immigrants/refugees is much cheaper outside Europe.

Many lives would be saved as the dangerous crossing to Europe would be stopped.

==========================

Europe can't solve all the problems of the world.

We should accept only those immigrants/refugees that we can safely integrate in our societies. That means a thorough check of those (limited numbers) we let come in (as Canada, Australia... are doing).

1430," 6 talking points to destroy the economic argument against immigration. 

1: Low-skill immigrants only (maybe) compete with non-high school graduates.

2: Non-high school graduates are a tiny fraction of America's native-born 
 population (6-8%).

3: The other 92-94% of Americans (high-school graduates and college graduates) benefit from lower prices. 

4: The money saved from lower prices is spent on other goods and/or invested, creating jobs in other sectors.

5: Restricting immigration does nothing for the wages of low-skill Americans if these Americans aren't willing to move across the country just to get paid near-minimum wage salaries for work in agriculture, lawn-care, and as nannies. More likely, you'd just see low-skill Americans paying more for groceries and other immigrant-produced items (just like everyone else).

6: There are far less costly ways to help the least skilled Americans (adult education programs, skills training, wage subsidy, earned income tax credit) which are more likely to work, would have a bigger effect, and would cost the other 92-94% of Americans a hell of a lot less.

I mean...wow. I have to say...the people's hatred for Jews is actually pretty impressive if they can circle back to hate before even a single lifetime after gassing them.

That means that many state Medicaid services will be cut or eliminated. In addition, the legislature has decided that a good place to cut spending would be on mental health and suicide prevention.

A paper published in 2014, showed that the rates of consanguinity had decreased to 29.7% or 37.9%, based on the part of the population being tested. A point that you might find interesting is that rates of consanguinity were higher in children of consanguineous parents (52.3), which points towards the effect of familial traditions on marriage. 

One last thing I'd like to point out is that this phenomenon isn't strictly Saudi, it also extends to other neighbouring countries, especially the Arab Persian Gulf countries. In my own country, Bahrain, rates of consanguinity fell from 24% to 7% across a span of 19 years. The reason behind this change is yet to be determined, since no efforts were held by the MoH to educate the public or anything of that sort.

What he actually said was that CO2 was beneficial, as were the Jews, but they had both been unfairly demonised.

He also said that his reasoning for CO2 being beneficial was that it accelerates growth of plants - and this effect is currently employed in many closed environments such as greenhouses - to promote plant growth.

He has also stated that the CO2 warming effect is logarithmic - not linear, meaning that for each unit increase in CO2, a diminishing heating effect is caused, (and that this heating effect is already in excess of 80% of its potential heating effect), and refers to studies that substantiate this claim.

In spite of these points and many others, he has stated CO2 is not the enemy, but also that he hopes him saying that doesn't detract from many other legitimate environmental issues such as depleting the natural resources of the world.

Reality is, you folks are too civilised to handle these refugees. You are just too kind, too sensitive.

When you break a vase your mom says ""No James, what you did was wrong"" and sends you to your room before complaining to your father. Then you father comes and gives you a constructive speech about not breaking vases and stuff.

When these refugee folks want to break a vase they can't because they don't have any since everywhere is bombed and raised to the ground. If they find something to break, mom comes and beats him up, then doesn't send him to his room because he has no room they all sleep together. Then his father (maybe-If he's still alive) comes, sees the broken stuff, beats up his mother, beats up our refugee friend.

Good luck with that. The SC has always upheld the POTUS decisions in the area of immigration .   They have turned many challenges to Presidential decisions to exclude people from coming here even those based on race , national origin and politics.   Not unlikely they would uphold this EO too especially since it is limited in duration and incorporates a list of countries identified by the previous administration based on intelligence developed through DHS.   The federal courts usually defer to the executive branch and their agencies in these matters.   By the way , Yemen is one of the countries identified by the EO and the US has boots on the ground in that country  .

I'm a child of immigrants born in the USA. I didn't grow up in Miami or El Paso so my accent is American.

As a supporter of all people, I wonder what the situation with this is.  So here is the trouble I have.  Judiasm is a religion and so if people say things like ""This is for the Jews to get influence in America"" are they being bad? Or are they just pointing out that ""Christians are buying influence as a block""?

I have so much trouble with Jewish because of things like this.  If I don't like religion but I have zero problems with anyone because of their heritage or ethnicity it can come off sounding bad.

If someone says ""Israel unduly influences our politicians with lobbyists"" is that anti-Semitic? If so, why?

Some of the stuff she says is clearly bad to me but I want to not be super sensitive either but as a person that is neither Ethnically Jewish or Religious in any way this has always confused me.

I personally have never understood why people hate and blame Jews for ills but I get very confused because to me the religion is not something I believe and I find strange, just like all organized religion.

Students get taxed at their college address, spend money at their college address, live and engage at their college address but local government wanted to deny them the ability to vote in that same jurisdiction.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember in college what a huge issue this was. It was not so much about the federal elections but more that the local gov't was trying to take policies that impacted students and the university in significant ways and as a part of that were attempting to remove students right to vote locally since students are effectively a proxy for the institution. A big part of why this eventually failed was a massive get out the vote campaign to make students aware that if they are not participating then there is a very direct connection to losing their ability to impact their local results, almost always to their detriment.

So, while I do appreciate the 'liberal profs are indoctrinating the youths' if you take a more nuanced and local view you can maybe possibly see how making sure students vote is a key way that students, profs and educational institutions can have a say in state and local elections that impact them.

Egypt might also be reluctant, There is the historical collective memory of the North Yemen Civil War,of the 60's, in which Egypt lost nearly 30,000 men,fightingon the side of Soviet backed Yemeni rebel forces against royalist forces,backed by Jordan,Saudi Arabia and Britain.The war has sometimes been referred to as ""Egypt's Vietnam"" . The Egyptians do not relish the possible prospect of another military quagmire.

Police in Carmel, Indiana launched an investigation after anti-Semitic graffiti was discovered spray-painted on a synagogue Sunday morning.

A Nazi flag and other anti-Semitic symbols were painted on the Congregation Shaarey Tefilla, Vice President Mike Pencewrote on Twitter.

""Sickened and appalled by the cowardly act of vandalism at Congregation Shaarey Tefilla,"" Pence tweeted, referring to the synagogue as ""beautiful"" and a place where he has ""many good friends.""

The vice president added that, ""Those responsible must be held accountable. These vile acts of anti-Semitism must end.""

Police confirmed onFacebookthat they're investigating the incident, and that such acts ""will not be tolerated in our community."" Authorities, according toFox 59, believe the culprits acted on Saturday.

Mayor Jim Brainard said in a statement that the graffiti ""does not reflect the respectful and welcoming nature of the vast majority of our residents who come from many different cultural and faith backgrounds.""

The synagogue, in a statement, said that they're ""deeply disappointed in the horrific vandalism that occurred at our Congregation,"" and noted, ""Intolerance, hatred, and violent acts against Jews are significant realities today.""

""The response to this heinous act affirms that American is collectively outraged at these hateful acts in our neighborhoods,"" the Congregation added.

Employers can face stiff penalties for IRCA violations that include substantial fines and debarment from government contracts. Penalties can be imposed for hiring unauthorized workers as well as simply for committing paperwork violations even if all workers are authorized to work. Fines for hiring unauthorized workers will amount to anywhere from $250 to $5,500 per worker depending on the prior history of violation. Employers can also be barred from competing for government contracts for a year if they knowingly hire or continue to employ unauthorized aliens. Paperwork violations can also result in significant fines. Each mistake or missing item on a form can result in a $100 penalty up to $1000 for each form. A missing form would automatically be assessed at $1000. An employer, for example, that had 100 employees and did not complete I-9 Forms might face a $100,000 fine. IRCA investigators have considerable discretion in assessing fines and will look at factors like the size of the company, the seriousness of the violations, whether the employer was trying to comply in good faith and the pattern of past violations. 

Employers should also be cautioned that knowingly accepting fraudulent documents from employees is a different kind of violation that can be criminally prosecuted under other immigration laws.

1. ""The total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities is unknown.""

2. ""Officials estimated that ORR received and released thousands of separated children prior to a June 26, 2018, court order in Ms. L v. ICE that required ORR to identify and reunify certain separated
children in its care as of that date.""

3. ""HHS faced significant challenges in identifying separated children, including the lack of an existing, integrated data system to track separated families across HHS and DHS and the complexity of determining which children should be considered separated. Owing to these and other difficulties, additional children of Ms. L v. ICE class members were still being identified more than five months after the original court order to do so.""
