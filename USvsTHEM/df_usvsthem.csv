 - All prices are the high point reached on the respective date, not the closing or opening. I did it this way because I wanted to.

 - I don't have any position in Starbucks' stock (SBUX) and am merely sharing out of general interest. I wouldn't touch that shithole with a 10 foot pole. Maybe if it was 10 feet longer, I might think about it then..

 - The January 30th date for the values is because the markets were closed on the 29th. 

 - [Here is the site I got the historical prices from](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/djia/historical). It may include all the tickers, but it may not. The URL only says ""*/symbol/DJIA/historical*"", so I'm thinking it's a cookies type of deal.

We know now that the term ""alt-right"" belongs to the Richard Spencer/Jared Taylor white nationalist movement (since it was Spencer who actually coined the term).

The refugees have stayed in Pakistan as early as 1979, fleeing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the later subsequent wars.

Many of the refugees turned to crime or religious extremism, bolstering the Taliban numbers. As such many Pakistanis are critical of this decision, seeing it as granting citizenship to criminal and Taliban Afghans. However the granting of citizenship will both decrease the crime committed by these refugees and give them a chance to a better life.

2.  This is wrong in every particular. Obama’s Iraqi visa policy in 2011 did not ban Iraqis from entering the country. Obama’s immigration policy did not treat people with passports from the seven countries as unusually dangerous terrorism threats.

The problem I have, is that most critics (including Sam Harris)  have a very simplistic understanding of the religion. Critics of the faith talk about it as if it is monolithic and that the beliefs within Islam are fixed. They'll even argue that violent Islam is the true Islam even though very few scholars of Islam throughout history would have advocated for that kind of literalism.  They would've found it a very shallow way to interpret the Quran.   The truth is Islam has a long and diverse interpretive tradition and Sharia Law is a very fluid concept. It's always changing. 

I suggest you watch this video (only 12min). Its a snippet of a debate about whether Islam and democracy are compatible. The speaker explains very briefly the fluidity of Islam and Sharia Law.

**Title of article**: ""Two immigrant high school students who 'raped a fourteen-year-old girl in a bathroom' arrived in America **just months ago** from El Salvador and Guatemala


**DACA requirements**:Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time;
Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making your request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS; 


Unless the article is wrong about them arriving just months ago, they are completely ineligible for DACA. DACA makes sure that only those kids who are contributing members to society are eligible. It has very strict rules to ensure this, for example, anything beyond a traffic ticket can subject your daca to revocation depending on the court ruling and a DUI is an automatic revocation.

I wonder how the Jews would feel if some random nation started passing legislation to proclaim that they can't aren't a sovereign people, that they aren't allowed to have self-determination in another nation and to be placed in ghettos like the Gaza Strip....

OH WAIT, THAT ALREADY HAPPENED!

The author never explains why it's particularly relevant that he's a Syrian Muslim, it's pure pathos. The implication seems to be that he must be a good person for that fact and must have progressive beliefs; that he's automatically someone the left should ally with. 

The white left in this way I think is guilty of an implicit orientalism.

On the left, there's a somewhat less awful and false view that the refugees are all helpless creatures who wouldn't hurt a fly, and therefore should be allowed in.

Group 2) People who were taken into slavery and never left their country of origin.

If we wanted to specify what group of slaves it is we are talking about, what words should we use? 

I would use immigrant for group 1 and native for group 2. I have never assumed the word immigrant implied consent at all. 

If I am kidnapped and taken to Japan and I am kept against my will in Japan for decades and when the authorities finally bust through the door and rescue me from my captives and I am then given the choice to return to my native country or stay and reside in Japan. I then decide to stay in Japan and build a new life in the country I have known for most of life, am I an immigrant? I would say yes in that I am a pasty white dude who speaks native English and was not originally born in Japan so therefore I can't be a native to Japan so I must be an immigrant.

FACTS:
-Migrants come to border crossing to apply for asylum
-Migrant protests erupt due to long wait times in asylum application process
-Migrants try to charge through an opening in the border, some throwing rocks at border agents
-CBP responds by using tear gas to disperse crowd
-Some tear gas affects children whose parents participated in charge, and adults and children half a mile away after winds push gas that way.

OPINION BASED ON ABOVE:
-The migrants had no right to charge the border crossing, even if application process is slow
-Could CBP have avoided using tear gas? Yes, they have other ways of dispersing crowd like a loud bang that mimics a gun shot

They have a refugee program where they take people registered by the UN, and that's it. Anyone who turns up on a boat is sent to another country and refused resettlement in Australia.

This approach worked for decades and there were almost no arrivals by boat, then a left wing government came in and overturned the law because of some kind of ideological fixation about how terrible right wing policies are on refugees. Within a few years almost a thousand people had drowned (at least the ones we know about for certain) trying to reach Australia and by the time they finally reinstated the offshore processing laws around 50,000 people had turned up in boats.

But despite all that there was no actual rise in refugee intake. All that happened was people who managed to get to Australia by boat displaced people coming through other programs, mainly family reunion programs for refugees.

Since the offshore processing law has been reinstated the boat arrivals have dropped to almost nothing.

It was expensive and politically tough to do but it solved the problem of people dying in shitty boats in the middle of the ocean. The Australian government also tried to weasel their way out of doing anything politically difficult by making it about people smugglers but the general public wouldn't accept that and they were forced into taking significant action.

*30. Each child is assigned to a room with a mattress, a sink, and a toilet. There is no wall or divider enclosing the bathroom area, so the staff can see the children use the toilet through the window in the door to their room.

*37. There is a point system in place to reward children for good behavior and punish them for bad behavior. The children are required to use points if they want to have access to personal hygiene items such as toothpaste and soap.

*40. SVJC staff routinely insult, taunt, and harass the immigrant youth detained at the facility based on their language, race, and/or national origin.

*41. One child was called a ""Mexican Monkey"" by staff, another was told by a guard that ""dark people bother me""

*53. For example, Doe once became so frustrated by a staff member's repeated taunting that he pushed the staff member. In response, four SVJC staff members shoved Doe to the floor and piled on top of him, and they began hitting him in his abdomen with their elbows. Doe sustained significant bruising as a result.

Friday, May 17, 2013

Washington, D.C. 

""On May 10th, Lois Lerner, Director of Exempt Organizations for the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax exempt groups, finally acknowledged that the agency had been targeting conservative‑leaning political organizations.  Four days later the Treasury Inspector General for Taxpayer Administration confirmed that “The IRS used inappropriate criteria to identify organizations applying for tax exempt status.”  The report also confirmed that this abuse of power began as far back as 2010. 

This revelation goes against the very principles of free speech and liberty upon which this country was founded.  The blatant disregard with which the agency has treated Congress and the American taxpayer raises serious concerns about leadership at the IRS. ""

* Some have been picked up in Changbai county, close to China’s 880-mile border with North Korea. For runaways who make it across the Tumen river, which meanders between the two countries, Changbai is often the starting point of a punishing six-week odyssey to freedom in South Korea.

* Park said the number of annual arrivals had almost halved since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011, from up to 3,000 during the final five years of the reign of his father, Kim Jong-il, to less than 1,500. That number looks set to fall even further, with only 593 arrivals in the first six months of 2017. “It could be really low this year [and] I think the major factor is the security in China,” said Park.

* The three-star hotel would certainly provide good cover for Kim Jong-un’s agents. Each morning its 9th-floor breakfast hall – which has sweeping views over the China–North Korea Friendship Bridge and the North Korean city of Sinuiju – fills with North Korean guests.

Subject: letter to the editor/Rabbi Rosenberg

 This letter is a response to Rabbi Peretz , the education Minister of Israel, being criticized by the ADL for stating 
  that the scale of assimilation in North America and the world is like a second Holocaust. ( July 8 2019).  While I am aware that this comparison is hurtful to the survivors of the Holocaust and their children, I said the same thing years ago; at that time I was attacked by survivors and the press for my opinion. There is so much intermarriage today; people don't realize that it is 50-70% depending upon the city. If there is not a kosher conversion in the case of the mother, the child is not Jewish and that line of Jewish lineage dies. I have converted many to Judaism. Rabbis  must not stick their heads in the sand. We must convert as many people as we can back to Judaism, especially in the case of a baby born to a non Jewish mother. As a Rabbi I write this to help, not criticize. Rabbi Peretz was courageous; he told the truth. Now we need a courageous solution.

The pro-illegal immigration stance the dems had taken is the worse thing ever. Any rational person can see how badly it melds with their other talking points.

-restricted guns but no restriction on criminals that can come in

-voting rights for noncitizens but screaming about Russia

-welfare/medicine for illegals when the average middle class person has only that much to spare for anything

-protecting disadvantaged groups while letting noncitizens take their jobs

-pro-immigration but give preference to immigrants who break the law over those who do not

-endangering national security while talking of foreign interference.

Each license brings in a steady income every 4 years which could be decreased for undocumented immigrants while keeping the price the same. Every driver in the state is paying at LEAST $24, which is $6/year. Going off a quick google search, in 2016 NJ had over 6 million licensed drivers. Do some quick mental math and you find that is a lot of money, $144 million every 4 years, which isn't exactly accurate since everyone's licenses expire on different days and years. Now add permit costs, permit renewals, license duplicates, upgrades, downgrades, CDLs, vehicle registrations(which are every year except for brand new automobiles with new plates), titles, sales tax stemming from title transfers, tickets, suspensions and fees etc. The list goes on.

Netanyahu, Trump, Bolsanaro of Brazil and even the neo-Nazis in the Ukraine etc. As American progressives, we need to understand that right-wing Israel is working against us now.

After his failed presidential run in 2004, Dean became the DNC Chair and came up with the Fifty-State Strategy.

I honestly think we're still seeing the benefits of it today and should be something that the DNC doubles down on. 

Anyways, after getting a ton of props from in-power Democrats, Dean is left with nothing. Doesn't get a cabinet position or anything.

2148,2148,"God, here we go. More tripe from Vox overlooking the facts that don't suit their narrative - and of course it's Yglesias - who would have guessed?

There are numerous studies (in many countries) that show immigration isn't profitable in the long run. I can't recall the source (1) but an independent non-profit organization looked at immigration in a number of countries and found that *at best* it's a near-negligible net positive on the economy.

The economic factors involved in this are so complex I get really annoyed when some site like Vox (or even a right-leaning site) claims they've somehow figured out that immigration is either good or bad for the economy. I've seen studies from various countries (Canada, Denmark, UK) that show costs in the *billions.* I've seen studies that outright refute some of those same figures (or at least diminish them).

Nobody knows how this plays out. 

I admit I'm biased here and being pedantic because I think Vox is absolute shit but for them to boldly state ""Immigrants make most Americans richer, not poorer"" as though they're the final authority on the matter and they've just ""explained"" the issue to us annoys the hell out of me and reminds me why I dislike them so much.
