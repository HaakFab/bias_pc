Back to the actual point, ""sanctuary"" laws were designed to show that coming forward would not lead to deportation.  It wasn't about being treated poorly or other concerns with police behavior.  They were designed with a very specific intent, a victim or witness does not have to worry about deportation simply because they are a victim or witness.  People who come to the state for help should not be punished when they do.  That was the idea behind those laws.  Again I believe that makes sense and should be the way it is universally.

There is nothing about the 'Islamic World' in this, except in the simplest, most general sense of the term that 'A Muslim existed here at this time'.

If they were slaves and only slaves, there is no reason for Muslims to play a significant role in American history, which is why there was no legislation or influences regarding it, since they had no power, military, political, or cultural.

103,"*A Republican presidential elector has become the first to announce that he intends to defect from Donald Trump when he casts his vote as part of the electoral college, vowing to try and block the president-elect from reaching the White House.

Writing in the New York Times, Christopher Suprun has declared that he will break ranks with his fellow Republican electors in Texas and cast his vote for a GOP candidate whom he deems to be more fit for highest office. He argues that under the electoral college system he has the constitutional duty to vote according to his conscience, not just according to party loyalty – and his conscience tells him that Trump is unfit for the presidency.

Citing the Federalist Papers, the historic documents that laid out the principles behind the electoral college system, Surprun, who as a firefighter was one of the first responders to the Pentagon on 9/11, says that each elector must decide whether “candidates are qualified, not engaged in demagogy, and independent from foreign influence … Mr Trump urged violence against protesters at his rallies during the campaign. He speaks of retribution against his critics.”*

Surpun might be pissed at Trump who has been named as a co-conspirator in 911. Seriously, his private jet is alleged to have been used to smuggle in the bombs the FBI said were detonated in the basement of the building (leading to their collapse).",0.5342007913294324,False,Conservatives,left-center,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,The Guardian

266 of the 507 people that were refugees in 15/16 were from predominantly Muslim countries. Included in those are 5 of the 7 countries Trump has banned travel from.

Rape is rape. If you don't want to suffer repercussions from raping someone, don't rape. I don't care if the rapist gets his testicles stapled to a tree. Do.not.rape. It is the easiest thing in the world to NOT do something. It requires no effort to not do something.

I would say Pro-Palestinian activists do a great disservice to the Palestinians by coming out so much as Anti-Israel if I actually believed they cared about these people. They do not. These groups are entirely self-serving.
