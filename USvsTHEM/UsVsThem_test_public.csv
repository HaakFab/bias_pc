When Bannon called Breitbart ""the platform of the alt-right movement"", I think he misunderstood the definition of alt-right in the same way metacanada did when we had ""Alt-right before alt-right was a thing"" on our sidebar. Bannon, like many people, probably thought ""alt-right"" was the name for this new movement characterized by pepe memes, Milo/McInnis/Southern, The_Donald etc. It isn't. We know now that the term ""alt-right"" belongs to the Richard Spencer/Jared Taylor white nationalist movement (since it was Spencer who actually coined the term). But before this was known, we happily (and erroneously) described ourselves as alt-right, as did a lot of people and groups. I imagine Bannon used the expression erroneously in the same way when he called Breitbart (and by extension, himself) ""alt-right"".

The blame lies with whoever started applying the term ""alt-right"" to this new, popular right wing movement, and to a lesser extent, the rest of us for not knowing the true definition of the term beofre applying it to ourselves.

The author never explains why it's particularly relevant that he's a Syrian Muslim, it's pure pathos. The implication seems to be that he must be a good person for that fact and must have progressive beliefs; that he's automatically someone the left should ally with. 

The white left in this way I think is guilty of an implicit orientalism. On the far right they have an image of Muslim refugees as a hoard of rapists and terrorists, which is strictly awful and false. On the left, there's a somewhat less awful and false view that the refugees are all helpless creatures who wouldn't hurt a fly, and therefore should be allowed in. 

A position that more radically challenges eurocentrism would recognize that they're people and as such are complex individuals, sometimes ugly and hateful in that complexity. Some of them deserve a punch in the face. They still have a fundamental right to migrate freely, especially to escape the horror of war.

FACTS:
-Migrants come to border crossing to apply for asylum
-Migrant protests erupt due to long wait times in asylum application process
-Migrants try to charge through an opening in the border, some throwing rocks at border agents
-CBP responds by using tear gas to disperse crowd
-Some tear gas affects children whose parents participated in charge, and adults and children half a mile away after winds push gas that way.

OPINION BASED ON ABOVE:
-The migrants had no right to charge the border crossing, even if application process is slow
-Could CBP have avoided using tear gas? Yes, they have other ways of dispersing crowd like a loud bang that mimics a gun shot
-At the same time, the migrants with children who charged the border put their kids in harm's way, and I don't think that should be excluded from the conversation

*30. Each child is assigned to a room with a mattress, a sink, and a toilet. There is no wall or divider enclosing the bathroom area, so the staff can see the children use the toilet through the window in the door to their room.

*37. There is a point system in place to reward children for good behavior and punish them for bad behavior. The children are required to use points if they want to have access to personal hygiene items such as toothpaste and soap.

*40. SVJC staff routinely insult, taunt, and harass the immigrant youth detained at the facility based on their language, race, and/or national origin.

*41. One child was called a ""Mexican Monkey"" by staff, another was told by a guard that ""dark people bother me""

*53. For example, Doe once became so frustrated by a staff member's repeated taunting that he pushed the staff member. In response, four SVJC staff members shoved Doe to the floor and piled on top of him, and they began hitting him in his abdomen with their elbows. Doe sustained significant bruising as a result.

I find the stereotypes a bit comforting, especially for a show released around the holidays while I’m not around other Jews. A lot of things in this article feel a bit overly nit picky, and seem to expect the show to be the end all be all of Jews at this time period in America, addressing every single aspect of Jewish culture. But that’s not what this show is, it’s not a historical education, it’s a show, at its heart, about Midge, and about the people around her. And, often, as is ASP’s style, it’s a bit of a heightened, performative theatrical reality, where that performance aspect is really what takes center stage. 

It might be interesting to get a little bit more history on the Weissman/Maisel families, like when they arrived in the United States, but also, I’m not sure how much that matters.

""On May 10th, Lois Lerner, Director of Exempt Organizations for the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax exempt groups, finally acknowledged that the agency had been targeting conservative‑leaning political organizations.  Four days later the Treasury Inspector General for Taxpayer Administration confirmed that “The IRS used inappropriate criteria to identify organizations applying for tax exempt status.”  The report also confirmed that this abuse of power began as far back as 2010. 

This revelation goes against the very principles of free speech and liberty upon which this country was founded.  The blatant disregard with which the agency has treated Congress and the American taxpayer raises serious concerns about leadership at the IRS. ""

-pro-immigration but give preference to immigrants who break the law over those who do not

-endangering national security while talking of foreign interference.

&amp;#x200B;

Each license brings in a steady income every 4 years which could be decreased for undocumented immigrants while keeping the price the same. Every driver in the state is paying at LEAST $24, which is $6/year. Going off a quick google search, in 2016 NJ had over 6 million licensed drivers. Do some quick mental math and you find that is a lot of money, $144 million every 4 years, which isn't exactly accurate since everyone's licenses expire on different days and years. Now add permit costs, permit renewals, license duplicates, upgrades, downgrades, CDLs, vehicle registrations(which are every year except for brand new automobiles with new plates), titles, sales tax stemming from title transfers, tickets, suspensions and fees etc. The list goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

Why else would they propose a bill like this? To make money!  It's not about giving undocumented immigrants documents. It's not about accountability. It's definitely not about making their lives easier. It's always about money.
